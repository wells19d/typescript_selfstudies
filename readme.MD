# TypeScript Self Studies
One of my goals, post graduation from Emerging Digital Academy, is learning TypeScript. This repo will cover just that. 

- This is a self study course, I will be taking the lessons I learned, over the 20 week course at EDA, and turn them into TypeScript projects.
- The projects listed where all written in different languages, (jQuery, Node, Express, React) but I'll be moving them into TypeScript.
- Most of these projects will be base goal only, only until I've gone through all the projects.
- I'm going to try to include different styling types with the project as I go.
    - CSS
    - Bootstrap
    - Material UI
    - Tailwind

## Lesson List
- A checklist of assignments I'll be working on:
#
- Week 1-6: Javascript
    - [x] - Hello World
    - [x] - About Me & Description
        - Note: I've noticed that using a boolean statement during a if else statement, if the boolean is being looked at as as true or false, you don't need to compare if it is true or false. Just calling the variable will check.
        - ``` 
            if (adventurous) { // does not neet to be adventurous === true
                    console.log('Adventures are great!');
                } else {
                    console.log('How about we stay home?');

            if ((luckyNumber === 2) && (adventurous) ) { // does not need to be adventurous = true
                    console.log( '"Roll the Dice!"' );
                }
