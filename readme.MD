# Typescript Self Studies
One of my goals, post graduation from Emerging Digital Academy, is learning Typescript. This repo will cover just that. 

- This is a self study course, I will be taking the lessons I learned, over the 20 week course at EDA, and turn them into typescript projects.
- Most of these projects will be base goal only, only until I've gone through all the projects.
- I'm going to try to include different styling types with the project as I go.
    - CSS
    - Bootstrap
    - Material UI
    - Tailwind
